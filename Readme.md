# Hi, I'm Martyna!

I just started learning about testing.

It's kind of addicting

## I am also a musician
I have music and analytics abilities

## So far I learned:
How to write in Bash

 ```bash
cd 
cd ..
cd ../..
ls
ls -la
mkdir <folder>
touch <filename>
pwd
ls -lah
history
clear 
exit
```

I also know a few commands in Git

```bash
git status
git checkout -b <branchname>
git status
git add Readme.md
git commit -m "message"
git config --global user.email "email@test.test"
git config --global user.name "name"
git log
git diff
```
